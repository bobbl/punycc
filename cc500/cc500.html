<h1>CC500: a tiny self-hosting C compiler</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I wrote this tiny compiler, which translates a subset of C into x86
machine code, for fun. It has no use, unless it counts as educational.
I called it CC500 because I initally guessed it would take about 500
lines. It turned out to be about 600 lines even without the comments
and blank lines. With the comments and blank lines it has about 750
lines. It could be made shorter, but I wanted the code to be clear and
simple rather than obfuscated.</p>

<h2>Download</h2>

<p>Compilation:</p>

<pre>gcc cc500.c -o cc500_1
</pre>

<p>Self-compilation:</p>

<pre>./cc500_1 &lt; cc500.c &gt; cc500_2
chmod +x cc500_2
</pre>


<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>The compiler reads the whole program in C from stdin and writes an
ELF binary for Linux/x86 to stdout. The ELF binary is somewhat
non-standard as it consists of a single section that is both writable
and executable. It seems to work for me on a real Linux box, but it
might cause problems on an emulator.</p>

<p>No libraries are used. Tiny, machine-code implementations of
exit(), getchar(), malloc() and putchar() are included in the binary
that is generated. There is no free() as malloc() is just sbrk(),
really, implemented with two calls to brk().</p>

<p>There is almost no error-checking. With some invalid C programs the
compiler calls exit(1) instead of generating a binary, but in most
cases it generates a binary that crashes when you run it.</p>

<p>There is no preprocessor. The lexer looks for tokens that match one
of the following Perl regular expressions: <tt>/[a-z0-9_]+/</tt>,
<tt>/[&lt;=&gt;|&amp;!]+/</tt>, <tt>/'[^']*'/</tt>,
<tt>/"[^"]*"/</tt>, <tt>/./</tt>. Traditional C-style
comments are handled, but not C++-style comments.</p>

<p>The symbol table is implemented with a single array of char. The
type of each symbol is recorded as 'D' (defined global), 'U'
(undefined global), 'L' (local variable) or 'A' (argument of a
function) - see sym_get_value(). There is also an address recorded for
each symbol, but no type, as there is no type-checking and all arrays
are assumed to be arrays of char. The address of an 'L' or 'A' is its
position on the stack. The address of a 'D' is the position of that
function or global variable in the binary. The address of a 'U' is
also a pointer into the binary, but a pointer to where the symbol was
last used and the head of a linked list of all the forward references
to that symbol.</p>

<p>Scoping rules for local variables are implemented correctly as it is
easy to do so: at the end of a compound statement the pointer to the
end of the symbol table is restored to what it was at the start of the
compound statement - see the assignment to table_pos in statement().</p>

<p>I started off writing CC500 without local variables, but it felt very
unnatural. Nested scopes are an essential part of C and it is not easy
to write a recursive-descent parser without automatic variables.</p>

<p>It is assumed that all variables, arguments and return values are
char * or int, though the compiler does not even parse the types, let
alone record them in the symbol table. The functions that implement
the recursive-descent parser return 1, 2 or 3, corresponding to a
"char lval", "int lval" or "other" - see promote().</p>

<p>Each parsing function is preceded by a comment that documents the
syntactic structures recognised, in an obvious notation. In some cases
the code accepts additional, incorrect structures in addition to what
is documented in the comment. Only a tiny subset of C's operators are
accepted: just the ones I needed while writing the compiler. There are
no unary operators: instead of the indirection operator * you must use
x[y], where it is assumed that x is char * and y is int. The only
statements recognised are compound statements, expressions, if, while
and return. Local variable declarations, with initialisers, are
treated as a kind of statement. (If you write something like <tt>if
(x) int y;</tt> the compiler will not complain, but the binary will
crash.)</p>

<p>There are no arbitary limits on the length of symbols, number of
symbols are the like: all three buffers (token, table and code) are
supposed to be automatically extended as required by calls to
my_realloc().</p>

<h2>Extending it</h2>

<p>Some simple and obvious enhancements would be to print an
appropriate message message when an error is detected, check for
undefined globals, and allow main() to be anywhere in the file.</p>

<p>It would be easy to extend the compiler to handle the remaining
operators and statement types of C. To implement break and continue
you would probably add additional arguments to the parsing functions
that record the address and stack height of the current loop. The
easiest way to implement switch statements might be to add an argument
that records the location of the previous case label in the current
switch statement; a case label would then be translated with a
comparison and a branch forwards to the next case label. In general, C
is quite amenable to direct translation into machine code without
going through an IR (intermediate representation).</p>

<p>Extending the type system would be a bit more challenging. You
could correctly implement scalars and pointers, with type checking, by
adding a single integer field to the symbol table to record the type.
However, if you wanted to implement structs, or function pointers with
proper type checking, you would need a recursive data structure to
represent the types. It is interesting, but not really surprising,
that you start to start to need structs in the implementation language
at roughly the same point that you start to implement them. However,
C's types get interesting even without structs, unions and typedefs.
For example, <tt>void (*(*f())(void (*)(void)))(void);</tt> declares a
function that returns a pointer to a function that takes a pointer to
a function as an argument and returns another pointer to a function. I
must admit to finding that part of C's syntax rather difficult to
parse mentally. I'm glad we have computers to do it for us.</p>
